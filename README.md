This is a lab task in my web engineering course. It is a static website made with html ,css and javascript only.

It is made in  html with  css. You can use it in anyway . It'll be helpful for those who have began to learn web development.However you shouldn't use my image.

The HTML used in it include

Basic html5 structure

image tags

animations

keyframes

javascript

That's it. Happy Coding.
